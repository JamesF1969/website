## Who are we?
Founded in 2017, Technical Theatre Society is University of York’s event production society, providing live event design, installation and operation for student groups in York. 

We can help run the technical side of any event run by the university community, from theatre and presentations to dance and live music. We are equally comfortable working in venues small and large, and dedicated theatre spaces with their own equipment, or in temporary spaces with our portable lighting and sound.

Please drop us an email at [techsoc@yusu.org](mailto:techsoc@yusu.org) to get the conversation started.

We additionally offer equipment dry-hire, however we encourage you to first consider bringing the opportunity to us, giving you access to skills and resources provided for our own events. Dry-hire is chargeable and is considered and quoted individually.

## What can we provide?
We can provide you with all of the technical side of your event including sound, lighting and some elements of video. As the client you will be assigned a project manager, followed by a team of our members that will design and operate your event. The size of this team will depend on the size of your event. Often a single person can cover multiple roles.

### Lighting
We have a large stock of lighting fixtures, including conventionals, LEDs and Moving fixtures. We also have waterproof uplighters which are perfect for outdoor events. The variety of lights we can provide allow us to support both productions and corporate events. 

We train our members in how to operate our lights as well as how to best create effective and interesting lighting designs. If you have an initial vision for your production or specific requests for the lighting designer please pass these onto your project manager!

### Sound
We have multiple sound desks available for use including our SQ5 which has 48 Input channels and is able to cope with our largest productions. In addition to this we have several sets of microphones including SM58 and SM57 as well as condenser microphones and a set of drum mics. While we don’t own any, we also frequently work with radio mics and would be able to hire these in for you. We also have a line array as well as additional speakers that can be used alongside our mixing desks and microphones.

Our members are trained to use all of our mixing desks as well as additional ones that we hire in for larger productions. They are also trained in QLab which allows the use of music, sound effects and pre-recorded tracks in productions. If you have any specific requests for your sound designer please let your project manager know!

### Video
While we do not record events on our own we do own a few pieces of equipment in order that we can operate signage and pre-recorded video at events. If this is something you’re interested in please discuss this with your project manager. If you’re looking for your production or event to be recorded then we frequently work with YSTV in order to do this. 

### Further Hires
We regularly hire in additional equipment for events through a variety of sources. If you think you will need to do this please discuss it with your project manager as soon as possible as sourcing quotes and the correct equipment takes significantly longer than doing an event with just our own equipment.

Our most frequent hire is radio mics which vary in price depending on whether you are on or off campus as well as how many you’re looking to hire. In the past we’ve also hired drapes, mixing desks and additional lighting fixtures so if you have the budget for it we’ll probably be able to get it! If you’re unsure of your technical needs for the event then we’d be happy to discuss this with you and determine what we think is best.

## Our Charges
We charge a small fee to all events that we support in order to cover our consumable costs and maintenance of our equipment. These consumables include ear protection for our crew, tape and lamps. 

For all events, additional costs are passed onto you. These include costs for hires, fire alarm isolation, batteries and haze fluid. Another additional cost is to hire a van (see below). All of these costs are agreed with you before we purchase or agree to hiring anything and so your project manager will make you aware of them throughout the process.

For most events our array of equipment is sufficient, however for others (such as those in Central Hall or those that are larger in scale) we also pass on all expenses incurred for the event. This could be external hire, haze fluid, batteries, or anything else we feel are necessary for you event. Your assigned project manager can give you an idea of what this will cost and if you have any budget constraints it is worth talking to them. After the event we will send you an itemised invoice for you to pay. 

### Van Hire
For events that occur outside of a certain radius of the Dixon Drama Studio we may require you to cover the costs of van hire. This van will be able to be used by your society as well for transporting set, instruments or anything else you may need. We will provide drivers for the van and will organise hiring and collecting it. The cost will be agreed with you before we confirm the hire.

## Other things to do

### EMFs
While we are helping to support your event we won’t fill out any forms or book any rooms with the university for you. This includes filling out an EMF and we are only able to support events with approved EMFs. If you’re unsure what this is please ask your project manager and they will point you in the right direction. 

If your event is in Central Hall you must add “Technical arrangements organised through Techsoc" in the AV Arrangements box and select the “Smoke Generator” option within the special effect section of the form.

### Notice Times
The vast majority of our events are booked in over a month in advance of them happening. We ask that at a minimum we are given two weeks notice but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to support any event with this little notice due to us being booked up normally a term in advance, especially in the later weeks in term. 

In addition to this we ask that you let us know of any changes to do with the event as soon as possible. This might be a change to the line-up, a change of venue or date or a change in personnel e.g. the stage manager is someone different from who we expected. This just allows us to adapt to the new situation and provide the best possible support.
